Project Description: Amazon Electronics Sales Analysis
The Amazon Electronics Sales Analysis project focuses on analyzing the sales data of electronics products on Amazon. The dataset, which is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edusanketdk/electronics, provides valuable information such as user ratings, item categories, and timestamps of sales.

In this project, I utilized the dataset to extract insights and generate meaningful conclusions. Using Tableau visualization software, I created interactive dashboards to visualize the results effectively.

The analysis revealed several key findings. Firstly, the year 2015 stood out as the year with the highest sales figures. Additionally, the month of January exhibited the best sales performance. Moreover, the brands Bose and Logitech emerged as the top-selling brands, while the category of Headphones dominated in terms of sales volume.

On the other hand, the brand names EINCAR and DURAGADGET experienced relatively lower sales. Similarly, the category of Security and Surveillance products recorded the least number of sales.

By leveraging the power of Tableau dashboards, this project provides a comprehensive understanding of Amazon's electronics sales landscape, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and identify potential growth opportunities.
